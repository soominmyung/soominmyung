## I build practical AI & ML systems that turn complex data into decisions.

I specialise in **applied machine learning, deep learning architectures, and AI-driven workflow automation**.  
My work spans building **Transformer-based models, time-series forecasting systems, and scalable ETL pipelines** that support real operational decision-making.

I particularly enjoy transforming ambiguous business or behavioural problems into **structured, ML-ready formulations** — from signal engineering to modelling, evaluation, and deployment.

## What I Do as an Applied ML & Data Scientist

**Deep Learning & ML Modelling** – Transformers, Siamese networks, CNNs, anomaly detection, preference learning, forecasting models.  

**Behavioural & Time-Series Modelling** – ARIMA/Prophet/Statsmodels, sequence modelling, pattern extraction, regime-aware signal engineering.  

**AI Workflow Automation** – RAG prototypes (GPT, LangChain, FAISS), document summarisation, email drafting, automated reasoning flows.  

**Data Engineering Foundations** – PySpark ETL, SQL Server pipelines, scheduling/automation, enterprise-scale data integration.  

**Operational Analytics** – BI dashboards, KPI systems, end-to-end reporting automation.  

**Scientific & Spatial Modelling (Legacy Work)** – Hydrology, spatial interpolation, environmental modelling (QGIS, R).
