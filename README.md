## 📊 Data is more than numbers. It’s the bridge between decisions and impact!

I focus on turning raw data into business insights and process improvements that create real value.
My role is to ensure that non-technical stakeholders — from C-suite to colleagues and customers — can benefit effortlessly from data.

## 💼 What I Do as a Data Scientist

I build **end-to-end data solutions** that connect business operations with analytics — combining technical depth with stakeholder collaboration.  
My experience spans **retail, logistics, commercial, and environmental domains**, delivering measurable impact through automation, forecasting, and spatial modelling.

<br>

⚡ **Stock ETL (PySpark + SQL Server)** – Automated daily inventory history pipeline, improving data accuracy and supporting reliable demand forecasting.  

📈 **Sales Forecasting (Time-Series Modelling)** – Captured seasonality and holiday effects using ARIMA and Prophet; integrated predictions into ETL workflows for proactive stock planning.  

📊 **KPI Dashboards (Tableau / Power BI + SQL)** – Unified sales and stock views to enhance replenishment efficiency and reduce lost sales.  

🔍 **Anomaly & Fraud Detection (SQL + Python)** – Detected irregular claims and unusual transaction patterns through rule-based and clustering approaches.  

🤖 **Automated Reporting (SAP B1 + SQL + Scheduler)** – Deployed scheduled jobs to replace manual reporting, saving hundreds of staff hours annually.  

🌍 **Environmental & Spatial Modelling (R + QGIS + Flood Modeller + Python)** – Conducted rainfall analysis, hydrological simulations, ETo estimation, and glacier runoff modelling using spatial interpolation and regression techniques.
