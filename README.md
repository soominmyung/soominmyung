## 📊 Data is more than numbers. It’s the bridge between decisions and impact!

I focus on turning raw data into business insights and process improvements that create real value.

My role is to ensure that non-technical stakeholders — from C-suite to colleagues and customers — can benefit effortlessly from data.

## 💼 What I Do as a Data Scientist

I design and deliver data solutions that connect business operations with analytics, combining technical depth with stakeholder collaboration.
My work spans retail, logistics, and commercial domains, solving real-world problems through data-driven decision-making and automation.

⚡ Stock ETL (PySpark + SQL Server): automated daily inventory history, contributing to better forecasting and measurable revenue growth.

📈 Sales Forecasting (time-series modelling): built models that capture seasonality and holiday effects, integrated with ETL workflows for proactive stock planning.

📊 KPI Dashboards (Tableau + SQL): combined sales and stock views to support smarter replenishment and reduce lost sales.

🔍 Anomaly & Fraud Detection: identified irregular claims and transactions through SQL logic and clustering-based detection.

🤖 Automated Reporting (SAP + SQL): replaced manual reporting with scheduled jobs, saving hundreds of staff hours annually.
