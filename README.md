## Core Expertise & Solutions 

### AI Automation & Orchestration

**Multi-Agent Pipelines:** Designing collaborative LLM workflows using LangChain to automate complex reasoning tasks (Analysis, Document Drafting, Emailing).

**Production-Grade RAG:** Implementing high-precision retrieval using ChromaDB with advanced metadata filtering and Regex-based data ingestion.

**Prompt Engineering:** Developing robust system prompts with strict guardrails to ensure business-professional and safe AI outputs.

<br>

### Full-Stack AI Engineering

**High-Performance APIs:** Building asynchronous backends with FastAPI featuring Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time progress streaming.

**Frontend Integration:** Seamlessly connecting AI backends to modern UI/UX platforms like Framer and React.

**Containerized Deployment:** Optimizing AI microservices for scalable deployment using Docker and Hugging Face Spaces.

<br>

### ML Modeling & Data Processing

**Supply Chain Intelligence:** Translating complex business logic (Lead-times, depletion trends) into automated computation layers for inventory forecasting.

**Automated Data Engineering:** Developing ETL utilities for seamless parsing and transformation of diverse formats (CSV, PDF, DOCX).

**Deep Learning:** Experience with Transformers, Siamese networks, and anomaly detection for structured and unstructured data.

<br>

### Operational Analytics

**Automated Reporting:** End-to-end automation of enterprise artefacts (Analysis Reports, Purchase Requests) stored in structured document libraries.

**BI & Dashboards:** Leveraging Tableau and Power BI for KPI visualization and operational decision support.
